## OT Security 

Gartner defines OT security as, “Practices and technologies used to (a) protect people, assets, and information, (b) monitor and/or control physical devices, processes and events, and 
(c) initiate state changes to enterprise OT systems.” OT security solutions include a wide range of security technologies from next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) to security information and 
event management (SIEM) systems to identity access and management, and much more.

## 1. Difference between IT and OT

Operational technology controls equipment, information technology (IT), controls data. Specifically, IT focuses on securing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.
SCADA systems collect data from sensors, often at distributed sites and send it to a central computer that manages and controls the data. DCS are used to manage local controllers or devices 
of production systems in one location.
Industrial control systems (ICS) are a main component of operational technology. ICS includes different types of devices, systems, controls, and networks that manage a variety of industrial
processes. The most common are supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and distributed control systems (DCS).

## Comman Threats and Vulnerabilities in OT Environment
   
   ## Weakness:
   
   1. Direct Internet Connections
   2. Insecure Passwords
   3. Unnecessary Exposure
   4. Outdated Operating System
   
   ## Challenges in OT Threat Detection
   
   1. Lack of bespoke skills
   2. Changing adversarial tactics
   3. Disparate tool sets
   4. Passive, manual tooling
   5. Old equipment, exposed endpoints

## How to Secure OT Environment

1. Secure Access/Centralized Logging
2. Asset Management
3. Software Vulnerability Analysis
4.  Patching Management
5.  Network Segmentation
6.  Backup Management

## Access Control

Access control is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. It is a fundamental concept in security that minimizes risk to the 
business or organization.
Two types of access control: physical and logical. 
Physical access control limits access to campuses, buildings, rooms and physical IT assets. 
Logical access control limits connections to computer networks, system files and data.

## Importance of Access Control

The goal of access control is to minimize the security risk of unauthorized access to physical and logical systems. Access control is a fundamental component of security compliance programs
that ensures security technology and access control policies are in place to protect confidential information, such as customer data.
Access control systems are complex and can be challenging to manage in dynamic IT environments that involve on-premises systems and cloud services.

## Working of Access Control

Access controls identify an individual or entity, verify the person or application is who or what it claims to be, and authorizes the access level and set of actions associated with the username 
or IP address. Directory services and protocols, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol and Security Assertion Markup Language, provide access controls for authenticating and authorizing 
users and entities and enabling them to connect to computer resources, such as distributed applications and web servers.

## Types of Access Control

1. Mandatory access control (MAC)
2. Discretionary access control (DAC).
3. Role-based access control (RBAC).
4. Rule-based access control.
5. Attribute-based access control.

## Implementaion of Access Control

Access control is integrated into an organization's IT environment. It can involve identity management and access management systems. These systems provide access control software, a user database 
and management tools for access control policies, auditing and enforcement.
When a user is added to an access management system, system administrators use an automated provisioning system to set up permissions based on access control frameworks, job responsibilities and workflows.
The best practice of least privilege restricts access to only resources that employees require to perform their immediate job functions.

## Challenges of Access Control

1. Dynamically managing distributed IT environments
2. Password fatigue
3. Compliance visibility through consistent reporting
4. Centralizing user directories and avoiding application-specific silos
5. Data governance and visibility through consistent reporting

## Principle of Least Privelege(POLP)

The principle of least privilege is the idea that at any user, program, or process should have only the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform its function. For example, a user account created for 
pulling records from a database doesn’t need admin rights, while a programmer whose main function is updating lines of legacy code doesn’t need access to financial records. The principle of least privilege 
can also be referred to as the principle of minimal privilege (POMP) or the principle of least authority (POLA). Following the principle of least privilege is considered a best practice in information security.

## Benefits of the Principle of Least Privilege

1. Better security
2. Minimized attack surface
3. Limited malware propagation
4. Better stability
5. Improved audit readiness

## Implementation of POLP

1. Conduct a privilege audit
2. Start all accounts with least privilege
3. Enforce the separation of privileges
4. Use just in time privileges
5. Make individual actions traceable
6. Make it regular
