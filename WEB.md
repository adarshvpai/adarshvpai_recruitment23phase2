  ## SQL Injection
  1. SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application's input fields or
     parameters, which are then executed by the application's database server.
  2.  SQL injection can occur in various parts of a web application, such as user input fields (e.g., search boxes, login forms), URL parameters,
      cookies, and even HTTP headers.
  3. Attackers use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to a database, steal sensitive information, modify or delete data, execute administrative
     operations, or even compromise the entire web application.
  4. Blind SQL injection vulnerabilities:In cases where the application doesn't display database errors, attackers use boolean-based or time-based
     techniques to infer information from the database indirectly.
